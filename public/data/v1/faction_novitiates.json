You cannot use more than one ACT OF FAITH per sequence, and their costs and effects are as follows: \r\n\r\n\r\nGUIDANCE  - 1 FAITH POINT - You can re-roll one of your dice. \r\nBLESSING - 2 FAITH POINTS - You can retain one of your normal successes as a critical success instead. \r\nINTERVENTION - 3 FAITH POINTS - You can retain one of your fails as a normal success instead of discarding it."
