When you do, you can either expend that operative or have it emerge. If it emerges, set it up in the killzone in a location it can be placed as follows (it’s no longer set up in HIDING):\r\n- Wholly within 6\" of your drop zone.\r\n- More than 6\" from enemy operatives.\r\n- With an order of your choice.\r\nThe operative is treated as performing the Reposition action (spend the AP accordingly), then continue its activation as normal. If the operative is a WARRIOR, ignore its **Group Activation** rule. Friendly operatives still in HIDING at the end of the second turning point are incapacitated."
