Communion points are used as follows (**OVERSIGHT DRONE** operatives are unaffected by the following):\r\n1. Whenever a friendly **VESPID STINGWING** operative is performing the **Shoot** action, it can only target the closest enemy operative within 8\" of it (excluding enemy operatives within control range of other friendly **VESPID STINGWING** operatives) unless you spend 1 of your Communion points. For weapons with the Blast and Torrent weapon rules, only the first target must be selected in this way.\r\n2. Whenever a friendly **VESPID STINGWING** operative performs the **Charge** action, it must finish the action within control range of the closest enemy operative it can unless you spend 1 of your Communion points.\r\n3. Whenever you would perform the **Pick Up Marker** or a mission action (excluding **Operate Hatch**) with a friendly **VESPID STINGWING** operative, you must also spend 1 of your Communion points to do so.\r\n4. Whenever a friendly **VESPID STINGWING** operative is shooting, you can spend 1 (and only 1) of your Communion points to re‑roll one attack dice."

Note that it gains no additional distance when performing the **Charge** action. It must be set up in a location it can be placed, and unless it’s the **Charge** action, it cannot be set up within control range of an enemy operative."
