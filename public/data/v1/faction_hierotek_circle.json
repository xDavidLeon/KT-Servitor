Then remove it as incapacitated, also removing any tokens and rules effects it had (e.g. **CHRONOMANCER** operative’s Chronometron action, Poison tokens, APL stat changes, being implanted, etc.).\r\nIn the Ready step of each Strategy phase, select one of your Reanimation markers and roll one D6: on a 1-2, leave that Reanimation marker in the killzone and repeat this process with a different one of your Reanimation markers (if any); on a 3+, an operative is **REANIMATED**.\r\nYou can only select each of your Reanimation markers once per turning point, and once you roll a 3+, you don’t select any more for that turning point. Whenever an operative is **REANIMATED**:\r\n- Set up the operative that Reanimation marker was placed for (it’s no longer incapacitated). It must be placed within 3\" of that Reanimation marker and not within control range of enemy operatives (if you cannot do so, treat the roll as 1-2 instead).\r\n- It has 1 wound remaining.\r\n- It has an order of your choice and is ready.\r\n- Remove that Reanimation marker.\r\nFor the purposes of the kill op, your opponent treats your starting number of HIEROTEK CIRCLE operatives as 5 (in other words, their kill grade goes up whenever a friendly HIEROTEK CIRCLE operative is incapacitated, to a maximum kill grade of 5). REANIMATED operatives don’t retroactively change any other VPs your opponent has scored, e.g. from tac ops."
