Whenever a friendly operative turns into a new operative:\r\n• Swap the miniatures, ensuring the centre of the new miniature’s base is as close as possible to where the centre of the old miniature’s base was. This can put it within control range of enemy operatives, and if the old miniature was, the new miniature must be if possible.\r\n• The new operative type loses a number of wounds equal to the lost wounds of its preceding operative type.\r\n• It’s still the same operative for any rules it’s already been selected for. The operative is simply a new operative type and will use that new type’s miniature and datacard rules."
