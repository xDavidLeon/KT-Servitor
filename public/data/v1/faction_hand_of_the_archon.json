If that enemy operative had a Wounds stat of 12 or more, that friendly operative gains two of your Pain tokens instead. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can spend friendly operatives’ Pain tokens on the invigorations below when the ‘when’ condition is met. You cannot use more than one invigoration per activation or counteraction, except Stimulated Senses, which can be used in addition to other invigorations. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Dark Animus**\r\nWhen: During the operative’s activation, before or after it performs an action.\r\nEffect: Until the start of the operative’s next activation, add 1 to its APL stat. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Accelerated Rejuvenation**\r\nWhen: During the operative’s activation or counteraction, before or after it performs an action. \r\nEffect: The operative regains D3+1 lost wounds. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Vitalised Surge**\r\nWhen: After the operative incapacitates an enemy operative and that enemy operative is removed from the killzone. \r\nEffect: The operative can immediately perform a free **Dash** action, even if it’s performed an action that prevents it from performing the **Dash** action.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Stimulated Senses**\r\nWhen: After rolling your attack or defence dice for the operative.\r\nEffect: You can re-roll any of your dice results of one result (e.g. results of 2)."
