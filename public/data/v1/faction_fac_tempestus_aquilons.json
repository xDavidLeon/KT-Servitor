      "description": "When setting up a **TEMPESTUS AQUILON** kill team before the battle, the first third of your kill team must be set up as normal. Each third thereafter can be set up above: place them to one side instead of in the killzone. For each third that’s set up above, you must set up the whole third in this way (not some of them), then place one of your Drop markers wholly within your drop zone.\r\nAs a **STRATEGIC GAMBIT** in the first and second turning point, you can move your Drop markers up to 4\", measuring the horizontal distance only. In a killzone that uses the close quarters rules (e.g. Killzone: Gallowdark), this can be measured and moved through Wall terrain.\r\nDuring the Firefight phase, friendly **TEMPESTUS AQUILON** operatives set up above are activated as normal. When you do, you can either expend or land that operative. If it lands, set it up in the killzone in a location it can be placed as follows (it’s no longer set up above):\r\n- Within 3\" of one of your Drop markers, measuring the horizontal distance only, or wholly within your drop zone.\r\n- Not within control range of enemy operatives (unless you’re setting up a **PRECURSOR** operative, which can be set up within control range of an enemy operative).\r\n- With no part of its base underneath Vantage terrain.\r\n- With an order of your choice.\r\nThe operative is treated as performing the **Reposition** action (spend the AP accordingly), then continue its activation as normal. It’s obscured until the end of the next activation or the end of the turning point (whichever comes first).\r\nLess than half of your operatives can be set up above by the end of the first turning point. In other words, by the end of the first turning point, more than half of your operatives must have been set up in the killzone during the battle.\r\nWhen readying your operatives during the second and third turning points, remove one of your Drop markers. This means operatives still set up above are incapacitated at the end of the second turning point."
