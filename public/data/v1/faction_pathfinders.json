Whenever a friendly **PATHFINDER** operative is shooting with a weapon from its datacard (excluding **ASSAULT GRENADIER’S** fusion grenade), it has additional rules determined by the number of your Markerlight tokens the target has. These are cumulative, so if an enemy operative has two of your  Markerlight tokens, the friendly operative shooting it has the rules for 1 and 2 tokens during that sequence."
