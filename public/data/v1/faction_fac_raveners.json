Whenever a friendly RAVENER operative is underground, it cannot perform any actions other than **Burrow**.

As a STRATEGIC GAMBIT in the first four turning points, you can place your next numbered Tunnel marker on the killzone floor wholly within 5\" of your preceding Tunnel marker. This means that, as the battle progresses, you can have a series of sequentially numbered Tunnel markers (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4). Once you have placed five tunnel markers, don't place any more (i.e. if your battle lasts more than four turning points).\r\nYour Tunnel markers and the area between your sequentially numbered markers (i.e. between 0 and 1, 1 and 2, etc.), create your TUNNEL.\r\nIn a killzone that uses the hazardous area rules (e.g. Killzone Bheta Decima), for the purposes of the Restricted Movement rule, parts of a Tunnel marker that are touching a hazardous area are treated as a hazardous area.\r\nIn a killzone that uses the close quarters rules (e.g. Killzone: Tomb World), your TUNNEL and the distance between your Tunnel markers can be measured through Wall terrain."
