If you do, subtract 1 from its APL stat until the end of that activation.\r\nAfter that activation, you can NETWORK COUNTERACT with one other friendly BATTLECLADE SERVITOR operative before your opponent activates. Whenever you NETWORK COUNTERACT with a friendly operative, first select its order. It can then perform a 1AP action for free, but cannot move. Once it's done so, your opponent then activates as normal.\r\nAn operative cannot TRANSFER POWER or NETWORK COUNTERACT if it has an APL stat of less than 2 (e.g. if the stat has been changed to less than 2 by a rule). NETWORK COUNTERACT is a counteraction, but the operative doesn't need to be expended with an Engage order to do it. That means if they're ready when they NETWORK COUNTERACT, they can still be activated as normal later in the turning point. An operative that does NETWORK COUNTERACT cannot do so again, or counteract, during the same turning point."
