You cannot use ploys and equipment associated with a REQUISITIONED operative’s former faction keyword, and you cannot use a REQUISITIONED operative’s former faction rules unless specified on their team selection list (it only applies to those REQUISITIONED operatives). Note that with their new faction keyword, REQUISITIONED operatives can interact with the INQUISITORIAL AGENT rules. For example, a REQUISITIONED VOX-OPERATOR operative from the DEATH KORPS group would have its DEATH KORPS keyword replaced in all instances on its datacard with INQUISITORIAL AGENT . This allows you to select any other friendly INQUISITORIAL AGENT operative for its Signal unique action. However, the Guardsman Orders faction rule isn’t permitted, so its Relay Orders additional rule would be ignored. It would now also be a valid operative for the INQUISITORIAL AGENT MYSTIC operative’s Scry unique action."
