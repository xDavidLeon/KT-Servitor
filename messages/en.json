Starting with the player that lost the roll-off, each player alternates either using an initiative card to alter the result of their roll or passing, until they both pass in succession.\n2. If player(s) would use their kill team rules to affect the roll-off, they must do so before playing initiative cards, starting with the player that's losing the roll-off.\n3. The Re-roll initiative card allows the player to re-roll their initiative roll. The remaining initiative cards all change the player's roll result up or down (this can take it above 6 or below 1).\n4. The winner of the roll-off decides who has initiative. Except during the fourth turning point, the loser of the roll-off gains an initiative card with a value equal to the turning point. If the roll-off is a tie, the player that didn't have initiative at that time is the winner.\n5. As a **Strategic Gambit** during the first turning point, each player secretly selects one of their three operations (Crit Op, Tac Op or Kill Op) as their Primary Op. Then, each player places a card with their choice face down, or uses a die or other method to indicate it.\n6. Each player can score a maximum of 6VP for each operation."

At the end of the battle, all players simultaneously reveal their primary operations. They score additional VP equal to half what they scored for that operation (rounding up).\n3. The player with the most VP is the winner. If players are tied, the battle is a draw."
